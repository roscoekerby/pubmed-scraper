37582856,AI-based skin cancer detection: the balance between access and overutilization.,"Gregoor et al. evaluated the healthcare implications and costs of an AI-enabled mobile health app for skin cancer detection, involving 18,960 beneficiaries of a Netherlands insurer. They report a 32% increase in claims for premalignant and malignant skin lesions among app users, largely attributed to benign skin lesions and leading to higher annual costs for app users (€64.97) compared to controls (€43.09). Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a comparable cost to dermatologist-based diagnosis alone. This editorial emphasizes the balance in AI-based dermatology between increased access and increased false positives resulting in overutilization. We suggest refining the diagnostic schemas with new referral pathways to capitalize on potential savings. We also discuss the importance of econometric analysis to evaluate the adoption of new technologies, as well as adapting payment models to mitigate the risk of overutilization inherent in AI-based diagnostics such as skin cancer detection.",NPJ digital medicine,eng,2023,08,15,Venkatesh Kaushik P; Raza Marium; Kvedar Joseph,No Keywords,10.1038/s41746-023-00900-0
34522050,"Human papillomaviruses: diversity, infection and host interactions.","Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are an ancient and highly successful group of viruses that have co-evolved with their host to replicate in specific anatomical niches of the stratified epithelia. They replicate persistently in dividing cells, hijack key host cellular processes to manipulate the cellular environment and escape immune detection, and produce virions in terminally differentiated cells that are shed from the host. Some HPVs cause benign, proliferative lesions on the skin and mucosa, and others are associated with the development of cancer. However, most HPVs cause infections that are asymptomatic and inapparent unless the immune system becomes compromised. To date, the genomes of almost 450 distinct HPV types have been isolated and sequenced. In this Review, I explore the diversity, evolution, infectious cycle, host interactions and disease association of HPVs.",Nature reviews.

38770982,S2k guideline for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa / acne inversa - Short version.,"The S2k guideline on hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa (HS/AI) aims to provide an accepted decision aid for the selection/implementation of appropriate/sufficient therapy. HS/AI is a chronic recurrent, inflammatory, potentially mutilating skin disease of the terminal hair follicle-glandular apparatus, with painful, inflammatory lesions in the apocrine gland-rich regions of the body. Its point prevalence in Germany is 0.3%, it is diagnosed with a delay of 10.0 ± 9.6 years. Abnormal differentiation of the keratinocytes of the hair follicle-gland apparatus and accompanying inflammation form the central pathogenetic basis. Primary HS/AI lesions are inflammatory nodules, abscesses and draining tunnels. Recurrences in the last 6 months with at least 2 lesions at the predilection sites point to HS/AI with a 97% accuracy. HS/AI patients suffer from a significant reduction in quality of life. For correct treatment decisions, classification and activity assessment should be done with a validated tool, such as the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Scoring System (IHS4). HS/AI is classified into two forms according to the degree of detectable inflammation: active, inflammatory (mild, moderate, and severe according to IHS4) and predominantly inactive, non-inflammatory (Hurley grade I, II and III) HS/AI. Oral tetracyclines or 5-day intravenous therapy with clindamycin are equal to the effectiveness of clindamycin/rifampicin. Subcutaneously administered adalimumab, secukinumab and bimekizumab are approved for the therapy of HS/AI. Various surgical procedures are available for the predominantly non-inflammatory disease form. Drug/surgical combinations are considered a holistic therapy method.",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,eng,2024,06,,Zouboulis Christos C; Bechara Falk G; Fritz Klaus; Goebeler Matthias; Hetzer Frank H; Just Elke; Kirsten Natalia; Kokolakis Georgios; Kurzen Hjalmar; Nikolakis Georgios; Pinter Andreas; Podda Maurizio; Rosinski Kerstin; Schneider-Burrus Sylke; Taube Klaus-M; Volz Thomas; Winkler Thomas; Kristandt Anna; Presser Dagmar; Zouboulis Viktor A,acne inversa; classification; guideline; hidradenitis suppurativa; severity; therapy,10.1111/ddg.15412
32917666,Radiomics Improves Cancer Screening and Early Detection.,"Imaging is a key technology in the early detection of cancers, including X-ray mammography, low-dose CT for lung cancer, or optical imaging for skin, esophageal, or colorectal cancers. Historically, imaging information in early detection schema was assessed qualitatively. However, the last decade has seen increased development of computerized tools that convert images into quantitative mineable data (radiomics), and their subsequent analyses with artificial intelligence (AI). These tools are improving diagnostic accuracy of early lesions to define risk and classify malignant/aggressive from benign/indolent disease. The first section of this review will briefly describe the various imaging modalities and their use as primary or secondary screens in an early detection pipeline. The second section will describe specific use cases to illustrate the breadth of imaging modalities as well as the benefits of quantitative image analytics. These will include optical (skin cancer), X-ray CT (pancreatic and lung cancer), X-ray mammography (breast cancer), multiparametric MRI (breast and prostate cancer), PET (pancreatic cancer), and ultrasound elastography (liver cancer). Finally, we will discuss the inexorable improvements in radiomics to build more robust classifier models and the significant limitations to this development, including access to well-annotated databases, and biological descriptors of the imaged feature data.<b>See all articles in this <i>CEBP Focus</i> section, ""NCI Early Detection Research Network: Making Cancer Detection Possible.""</b>","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",eng,2020,12,,Gillies Robert J; Schabath Matthew B,No Keywords,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-0075
34936739,Trial of Spesolimab for Generalized Pustular Psoriasis.,"Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare, life-threatening, inflammatory skin disease characterized by widespread eruption of sterile pustules. Interleukin-36 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Spesolimab, a humanized anti-interleukin-36 receptor monoclonal antibody, is being studied for the treatment of GPP flares. In a phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned patients with a GPP flare in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single 900-mg intravenous dose of spesolimab or placebo. Patients in both groups could receive an open-label dose of spesolimab on day 8, an open-label dose of spesolimab as a rescue medication after day 8, or both and were followed to week 12. The primary end point was a Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA) pustulation subscore of 0 (range, 0 [no visible pustules] to 4 [severe pustulation]) at the end of week 1. The key secondary end point was a GPPGA total score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin) at the end of week 1; scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. A total of 53 patients were enrolled: 35 were assigned to receive spesolimab and 18 to receive placebo. At baseline, 46% of the patients in the spesolimab group and 39% of those in the placebo group had a GPPGA pustulation subscore of 3, and 37% and 33%, respectively, had a pustulation subscore of 4. At the end of week 1, a total of 19 of 35 patients (54%) in the spesolimab group had a pustulation subscore of 0, as compared with 1 of 18 patients (6%) in the placebo group (difference, 49 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21 to 67; P<0.001). A total of 15 of 35 patients (43%) had a GPPGA total score of 0 or 1, as compared with 2 of 18 patients (11%) in the placebo group (difference, 32 percentage points; 95% CI, 2 to 53; P = 0.02). Drug reactions were reported in 2 patients who received spesolimab, in 1 of them concurrently with a drug-induced hepatic injury. Among patients assigned to the spesolimab group, infections occurred in 6 of 35 (17%) through the first week; among patients who received spesolimab at any time in the trial, infections had occurred in 24 of 51 (47%) at week 12. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 23 of 50 patients (46%) who received at least one dose of spesolimab. In a phase 2 randomized trial involving patients with GPP, the interleukin-36 receptor inhibitor spesolimab resulted in a higher incidence of lesion clearance at 1 week than placebo but was associated with infections and systemic drug reactions. Longer and larger trials are warranted to determine the effect and risks of spesolimab in patients with pustular psoriasis.
